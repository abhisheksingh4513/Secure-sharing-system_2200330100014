# ✅ **FIXES APPLIED - Download and Button Loading Issues Resolved**

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. HTTP 403 Download Error**
**Problem**: Download was failing with 403 error due to endpoint conflicts
**Solution**: 
- Changed download endpoint from `/files/download-file/{file_id}` to `/files/get-download-link/{file_id}`
- Changed secure download from `/files/download-file/{token}` to `/files/secure-download/{token}`
- This prevents URL pattern conflicts

### **2. Button Loading States**
**Problem**: Buttons were getting stuck in loading state
**Solution**:
- Added proper `try/catch/finally` blocks to all async functions
- Ensured button states are reset even if errors occur
- Added proper error handling and console logging

### **3. Download Method**
**Problem**: Download links were causing CORS issues
**Solution**:
- Changed from programmatic link clicking to `window.open()`
- Downloads now open in new tab, avoiding CORS restrictions
- Added debug logging to track download URLs
