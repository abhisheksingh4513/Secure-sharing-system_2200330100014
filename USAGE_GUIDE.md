## üåê **Sharing Your System**

### **Option 1: Local Network Sharing**
1. Find your local IP address:
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   # Look for IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   ```

2. Update the system to accept external connections:
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   - Restart with:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. Share this URL with others on your network:
   ```
   http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000
   # Example: http://192.168.1.100:8000
   ```

### **Option 2: Internet Sharing (Advanced)**
For internet access, you would need:
- Port forwarding on your router (port 8000)
- Dynamic DNS service
- SSL certificate for HTTPS
- Production database (PostgreSQL)

### **Option 3: Cloud Deployment**
Deploy to platforms like:
- **Heroku**: Free tier available
- **Railway**: Easy deployment
- **DigitalOcean**: VPS hosting
- **AWS/Google Cloud**: Enterprise solutions
